# Predicting Hospital Readmission with Discharge Summaries
Machine learning models were built for this project to predict 30-day unplanned hospital readmission using discharge summaries

# To Begin
Before running the Jupyter Notebook, you will need to access to the MIMIC-III database, a freely available hospital database. You can request access at https://mimic.physionet.org/gettingstarted/access/

From there, you will need to download the ADMISSIONS.csv and NOTEEVENTS.csv tables into this project's folder
