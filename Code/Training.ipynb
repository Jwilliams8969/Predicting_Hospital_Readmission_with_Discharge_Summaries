       "array(['   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 81-year-old female with a history of emphysema (not on home O2), who presents with three days of shortness of breath thought by her primary care doctor to be a COPD flare.  Two days prior to admission, she was started on a prednisone taper and one day prior to admission she required oxygen at home in order to maintain oxygen saturation greater than 90%.  She has also been on levofloxacin and nebulizers, and was not getting better, and presented to the  Emergency Room. In the  Emergency Room, her oxygen saturation was 100% on CPAP.  She was not able to be weaned off of this despite nebulizer treatment and Solu-Medrol 125 mg IV x2. Review of systems is negative for the following:  Fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, night sweats, change in weight, gastrointestinal complaints, neurologic changes, rashes, palpitations, orthopnea.  Is positive for the following: Chest pressure occasionally with shortness of breath with exertion, some shortness of breath that is positionally related, but is improved with nebulizer treatment. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. COPD.  Last pulmonary function tests in  demonstrated a FVC of 52% of predicted, a FEV1 of 54% of predicted, a MMF of 23% of predicted, and a FEV1:FVC ratio of 67% of predicted, that does not improve with bronchodilator treatment.  The FVC, however, does significantly improve with bronchodilator treatment consistent with her known reversible air flow obstruction in addition to an underlying restrictive ventilatory defect.  The patient has never been on home oxygen prior to this recent episode.  She has never been on steroid taper or been intubated in the past. 2. Lacunar CVA.  MRI of the head in  demonstrates \"mild degree of multiple small foci of high T2 signal within the white matter of both cerebral hemispheres as well as the pons, in the latter region predominantly to the right of midline.  The abnormalities, while nonspecific in etiology, are most likely secondary to chronic microvascular infarction.  There is no mass, lesion, shift of the normal midline strictures or hydrocephalus.  The major vascular flow patterns are preserved.  There is moderate right maxillary, moderate bilateral ethmoid, mild left maxillary, minimal right sphenoid, and frontal sinus mucosal thickening.  These abnormalities could represent an allergic or some other type of inflammatory process.  Additionally noted is a moderately enlarged subtotally empty sella turcica\". 3. Angina:  Most recent stress test was in  going for four minutes with a rate pressure product of 10,000, 64% of maximum predicted heart rate without evidence of ischemic EKG changes or symptoms.  The imaging portion of the study demonstrated no evidence of myocardial ischemia and a calculated ejection fraction of 84%.  The patient denies angina at rest and gets angina with walking a few blocks. Are alleviated by sublingual nitroglycerin. 4. Hypothyroidism on Synthroid. 5. Depression on Lexapro. 6. Motor vehicle accident with head injury approximately 10 years ago. MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: 1. Hydrochlorothiazide 25 q.d. 2. Prednisone 60 mg, 50 mg, 40 mg, 20 mg. 3. Levofloxacin 500 mg q.d. 4. Imdur 60 mg q.d. 5. Synthroid 75 mcg q.d. 6. Pulmicort nebulizer b.i.d. 7. Albuterol nebulizer q.4. prn. 8. Lexapro 10 mg q.d. 9. Protonix 40 mg q.d. 10. Aspirin 81 mg q.d. ALLERGIES:  Norvasc leads to lightheadedness and headache. FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory. SOCIAL HISTORY:  Lives with her husband, Dr.  an eminent Pediatric Neurologist at .  The patient is a prior smoker, but has not smoked in over 10 years.  She has no known alcohol use and she is a full code. PHYSICAL EXAM AT TIME OF ADMISSION:  Blood pressure 142/76, heart rate 100 and regular, respirations at 17-21, and 97% axillary temperature.  She was saturating at 100% on CPAP with dry mucous membranes.  An elderly female in no apparent distress.  Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation.  Extraocular movements are intact.  Oropharynx difficult to assess due to CPAP machine.  No evidence of jugular venous pressure, however, the strap from the CPAP machine obscures the neck exam.  Cranial nerves II through XII are grossly intact.  Neck is supple without lymphadenopathy.  Heart exam:  Tachycardic, regular, obscured by loud bilateral wheezing with increase in the expiratory phase as well as profuse scattered rhonchi throughout the lung fields.  Positive bowel sounds, soft, nontender, nondistended, obese, no masses.  Mild edema of the lower extremities without clubbing or cyanosis, no rashes.  There is a right hand hematoma.  Strength is assessed as  in the lower extremities,  in the upper extremities with a normal mental status and cognition. LABORATORY STUDIES:  White count 19, hematocrit 41, platelets 300.  Chem-7:  127, 3.6, 88, 29, 17, 0.6, 143.  Troponin was negative.  CKs were negative times three.  Initial blood gas showed a pH of 7.4, pO2 of 66, pCO2 of 54. Chest x-ray demonstrates a moderate sized hiatal hernia, segmental atelectasis, left lower lobe infiltrate versus segmental atelectasis. EKG shows normal sinus rhythm at 113 beats per minute, normal axis, no evidence of ST-T wave changes. BRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE: 1. COPD/dyspnea/pneumonia:  The patient was initially placed on an aggressive steroid taper and admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit due to her difficulty with oxygenation despite CPAP machine.  She was also given nebulizer treatments q.4h. as well as chest PT.  The nebulizers were increased to q.1h. due to the fact that she continued to have labored breathing. Due to persistent respiratory failure and labored breathing, the patient was intubated on  in order to improve oxygenation, ventilation, and ability to suction.  A bronchoscopy was performed on , which demonstrated marked narrowing of the airways with expiration consistent with tracheomalacia. On , two silicone stents were placed, one in the left main stem (12 x 25 and one in the trachea 16 x 40) by Dr.   under rigid bronchoscopy with general anesthesia. On , the patient was extubated to a cool mist shovel mask and her oxygen was titrated down to 2 liters nasal cannula at which time she was transferred to the medical floor.  On the medical floor, the steroids were weaned to off on , and the patient was saturating at 97% on 2 liters, 92% on room air. On , the patient was seen again by the Interventional Pulmonology service, who agreed that she looked much improved and recommended that she go to pulmonary rehabilitation with followup within six weeks\\' time status post placement of stents in respiratory failure. 2. Cardiovascular:  The patient was ruled out for a MI.  She did have another episode on the medical floor of chest pain, which showed no evidence of EKG changes and negative troponin, negative CKs x3.  She was continued on aspirin, Imdur, and diltiazem for rate control per her outpatient regimen. 3. Hypertension:  She was maintained on diltiazem and hydrochlorothiazide with adequate blood pressure control and normalization of electrolytes. 4. Hematuria:  The patient had intermittent hematuria likely secondary to Foley placement.  The Foley catheter was discontinued on .  She had serial urinalyses, which were all negative for signs of infection. 5. Hyperglycemia:  Patient was placed on insulin-sliding scale due to hyperglycemia, which was steroid induced.  This worked quite well and her glucose came back to normal levels once the steroids were tapered to off. 6. Leukocytosis:  Patient did have a profound leukocytosis of 20 to 22 during much of her hospital course.  As the steroids were tapered to off, her white blood cell count on  was 15,000.  It was felt that the leukocytosis was secondary to both steroids as well as question of a left lower lobe pneumonia. 7. For the left lower lobe pneumonia, the patient had initially received a course of levofloxacin 500 p.o. q.d. from  to .  This was restarted on  for an additional seven day course given the fact that she still had the leukocytosis and still had marked rales at the left lower lobe. 8. Hypothyroidism:  The patient was continued on outpatient medical regimen. 9. Depression:  The patient was continued on Lexapro per outpatient regimen.  It is recommended that she follow up with a therapist as an outpatient due to the fact that she did have a blunted affect throughout much of the hospital course, and did appear clinically to be depressed. 10. Prophylaxis:  She was maintained on proton-pump inhibitor with subQ Heparin. 11. Sore throat:  The patient did have a sore throat for much of the hospital course post extubation.  This was treated with Cepacol lozenges as well as KBL liquid (a solution containing Kaopectate, Bismuth, and lidocaine) at bedtime. 12. Communication/code status:  The patient was full code throughout her hospital course, and communication was maintained with the patient and her husband. 13. Muscle weakness:  The patient did have profound muscle weakness and was evaluated by Physical Therapy, and was found to have impaired functional mobility, impaired musculoskeletal performance, impaired gas exchange, impaired endurance, impaired ventilation, and needed help with supine to sit.  However, she was able to tolerate sitting in a chair for approximately one hour. On motor exam, her flexors and extensors of the lower extremities were  at the knee,  at the ankle,  at the elbows, and  hips.  It was felt that this weakness was most likely due to a combination of steroid myopathy as well as muscle atrophy secondary to deconditioning after a prolonged hospital course. 14. Speech/swallow:  The patient had a Speech and Swallow evaluation showing no evidence of dysphagia, no evidence of vocal cord damage status post tracheal stent placement. DISCHARGE CONDITION:  The patient was able to oxygenate on room air at 93% at the time of discharge.  She was profoundly weak, but was no longer tachycardic and had a normal blood pressure.  Her respirations were much improved albeit with transmitted upper airway sounds. DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient will be discharged to  for both pulmonary and physical rehabilitation. DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: 1. Levothyroxine 75 mcg p.o. q.d. 2. Citalopram 10 mg p.o. q.d. 3. Aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d. 4. Fluticasone 110 mcg two puffs inhaled b.i.d. 5. Salmeterol Diskus one inhalation b.i.d. 6. Acetaminophen 325-650 mg p.o. q.4-6h. prn. 7. Ipratropium bromide MDI two puffs inhaled q.2h. prn. 8. Albuterol 1-2 puffs inhaled q.2h. prn. 9. Zolpidem tartrate 5 mg p.o. q.h.s. prn. 10. Isosorbide dinitrate 10 mg p.o. t.i.d. 11. Diltiazem 60 mg p.o. q.i.d. 12. Pantoprazole 40 mg p.o. q.24h. 13. Trazodone 25 mg p.o. q.h.s. prn. 14. SubQ Heparin 5000 units subcutaneous b.i.d. until such time that the patient is able to get out of bed twice a day. 15. Cepacol lozenges q.2h. prn. 16. Levofloxacin 500 mg p.o. q.d. for a seven day course to be completed on . 17. Kaopectate/Benadryl/lidocaine 5 mL p.o. b.i.d. prn, not to be given around mealtimes for concern of dysphagia induced by lidocaine. 18. Lorazepam 0.5-2 mg IV q.6h. prn. FOLLOW-UP PLANS:  The patient is recommended to followup with Dr.  ,  within two weeks of leaving of the hospital.  She is also recommended to followup with the Interventional Pulmonary service for followup status post stent placement.  She is also recommended to followup with a neurologist if her muscle weakness does not improve within one week on physical therapy with concern for steroid-induced myopathy. FINAL DIAGNOSES: 1. Tracheomalacia status post tracheal and left main stem bronchial stent placement. 2. Hypertension. 3. Hypothyroidism. 4. Restrictive lung defect. 5. Depression.

Over the past five years she has had progressive difficulties with her breathing. In  she was admitted to  for respiratory failure due to a COPD exacerbation. Due to persistent hypoxemia, she required intubation and a eventual bronchoscopy on  revealed marked narrowing of the airways on expiration consistent with tracheomalacia. She subsequently underwent placement of two silicone stents, one in the left main stem and one in the trachea. During the admission the patient had complaints of chest pain and ruled out for an MI. She was subsequently discharged to  for physical and pulmonary rehab. Repeat bronchoscopy on  revealed granulation tissue at the distal right lateral wall of the tracheal stent. There was significant malacia of the peripheral and central airways with complete collapse of the airways on coughing and forced expiration. Small nodules were also noted on the vocal cords. She has noticed improvement in her respiratory status, but most recently has been in discussion with Dr.   regarding possible tracheobronchial plasty with mesh. Tracheal stents d/c  in anticipation of surgery. In terms of symptoms, she describes many years of intermittent chest pain that she describes as left sided and occurring at any time. Currently, she notices it about three times a week, and states that it seems to resolve after three nitroglycerin. She currently is dependent on oxygen and wears 1.5-2 liters around the clock. She has frequent coughing and brings up \"dark sputum\". Past Medical History: COPD flare  s/p intubation, s/p distal tracheal to Left Main Stem stents placed .

       "       \"  Allergies: Amlodipine Attending: Chief Complaint: COPD exacerbation/Shortness of Breath Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Intubation arterial line placement PICC line placement Esophagogastroduodenoscopy History of Present Illness: 87 yo F with h/o CHF, COPD on 5 L oxygen at baseline, tracheobronchomalacia s/p stent, presents with acute dyspnea over several days, and lethargy. This morning patient developed an acute worsening in dyspnea, and called EMS. EMS found patient tachypnic at saturating 90% on 5L. Patient was noted to be tripoding. She was given a nebulizer and brought to the ER. . According the patient's husband, she was experiencing symptoms consistent with prior COPD flares. Apparently patient was without cough, chest pain, fevers, chills, orthopnea, PND, dysuria, diarrhea, confusion and neck pain. Her husband is a physician and gave her a dose of levaquin this morning. . In the ED, patient was saturating 96% on NRB. CXR did not reveal any consolidation. Per report EKG was unremarkable. Laboratory evaluation revealed a leukocytosis if 14 and lactate of 2.2. Patient received combivent nebs, solumedrol 125 mg IV x1, aspirin 325 mg po x1. Mg sulfate 2 g IV x1, azithromycin 500 mg IVx1, levofloxacin 750 mg IVx1, and Cefrtiaxone 1g IVx1. Patient became tachpnic so was trialed on non-invasive ventilation but became hypotensive to systolics of 80, so noninvasive was removed and patient did well on NRB and nebulizers for about 2 hours. At that time patient became agitated, hypoxic to 87% and tachypnic to the 40s, so patient was intubated. Post intubation ABG was 7.3/60/88/31. Propafol was switched to fentanyl/midazolam for hypotension to the 80s. Received 2L of NS. On transfer, patient VS were 102, 87/33, 100% on 60% 450 x 18 PEEP 5. Patient has peripheral access x2. . In the ICU, patient appeared comfortable.

Limited exam. Echo () - There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). The estimated cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size is normal. with normal free wall contractility. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad. IMPRESSION: Normal biventricular systolic function. Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. CXR () - Kyphotic positioning. Compared with one day earlier and allowing for technical differences, the right-sided effusion may be slightly larger. Otherwise, no significant change is detected. Again seen is retrocardiac opacity consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation and a small left effusion. As noted, a right effusion is again seen, possibly slightly larger on the current examination, with underlying collapse and/or consolidation. Doubt CHF. Degenerative changes of the thoracic spine are noted.

Per report, patient felt like this with prior COPD exacerbations. Leukocytosis supports possible pneumonia, but history and CXR not entirely consistent with this. EKG with signs of demand, but ROMI negative. Sputum gram stain unremarkable, but respitatory viral culture grew parainfluenze type 3 on . Patient was initially managed on solumedrol 60 mg IV Q8H, and was eventually tapered. With no evidence of pneumonia on CXR and sputum gram stain, antibiotics were stopped . Beta-agonists and anticholinergics were continued around the clock. TTE revealed mild symmetric lvh with normal ef, increased pcwp (>18mmHg), Normal RV, and moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. On , bronchoscopy revealed collapsible, unremarkable airways. Patient had difficulty weaning from the vent, and would become interimittenty hypertensive to SBP 200s and tachypnic to the 50s. Patient was extubatied on  after passing SBT 0/5, but required re-intubation 30 minutes later for worsening secretions, lack of gag reflex, and tachypnea to the 50s. Of note, on , the patient was found to have MRSA growing in sputum samples. Although it was felt that this likely represented colonization as opposed to true infection, the patient was started on a course of vancomycin (which was stopped after 5 days). After multiple discussions between the patient's family and the ICU team, the patient's PCP,  the palliative care service, the patient's family ultimately decided that she would not want a tracheostomy. On , extubation was pursued again and was successful. After extubation, her respiratory status improved and she was ultimately called out to the medical floor. On the floor she was progressively weaned to 2LNC with nebs (better than her baseline 5L @home). Because of clinical exams revealing mild volume overload, she was intermittently diuresed. She also experienced intermittent shortness of breath with tachypnea but this was thought to be the result of attacks of anxiety with tachypnea. After receiving prn morphine, her breathing status would typically improve. A steroid taper was begun. The patient should continue prednisone 30 mg daily for 3 more days, then 20 mg daily for 4 days, then 10 mg daily for 4 days, then 5 mg daily for 4 days, then stop. . # Upper GI bleeding: On , patient had coffee grounds from OG tube. Lavage for approx 600ccs with clearance. GI perfomred EGD which revealed esophagitis, ulcers and blood in the stomach body, D2 diverticulum and large hiatal hernia. H pylori was negative. Patient was continued on IV PPI, with plan for repeat EGD in 8 weeks, and upper GI series once clinically improved given abnormal anatomy on EGD. Her hematocrit remained stable with no further episodes of upper GI bleeding throughout the patient's hospitalization. On the floor she was switched to PO pantoprazole twice daily. Aspirin was held. . # Weakness: The patient was found to have generalized weakness at the end of her hospitalization. Neurology was consulted and they felt it was likely due to a combination of steroid myopathy and deconditioning from her prolonged bedbound status. A TSH was checked which was normal. They recommended pulmonary and physical rehab. . # CAD: History of LAD and RCA stenosis on Cath, but no stents. Continued statin and beta blocker, but held aspirin for GI bleeding (see above) . # Nutrition: Unable to pass NG without direct visualization due to hiatal hernia. IR guided post pyloric NG tube was placed on  for TFs and po medications. NG tube was pulled when patient was extubated on . Speech and swallow were consulted following the patient's extubation and she was eventually moved to soft solids and thin liquids with 1:1 supervision. # Goals of care: PCP .  was very involved in discussions regarding patient's code status. Palliative care also followed along with the patient. Ultimately, at the time of the patient's extubation on , it was decided that the patient would be DNR/DNI (although this was later change). The patient's family felt that she would not want a tracheostomy. It was decided that she would not be reintubated and that, if her respiratory status were to worsen after intubation, care would be focused on comfort. However, her status improved in the MICU and on the floor and it was then decided that she would remain DNR with intubation (but no tracheostomy) if her breathing deteriorated. After several days with stable or improved overall clinical status, she was deemed suitable for rehabilitation. At the timem of discharge, the patient's code status was do not resuscitate, okay to intubate.
